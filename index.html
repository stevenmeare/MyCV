            Hi! My name is Steve, and I'm a ski instructor trainer, 
            indie game developer, and aspiring professional software engineer!
            I have a passion for people-facing roles and solving tricky, technical
            problems. I'm always looking for new opportunities to learn and grow.
        </p>

        <p>
            Having moved out of the ski industry during the COVID-19 pandemic, I have been
            working in administration and project support roles. In these roles, I have been
            able to apply skills developed in my hobbyist software development projects to
            automate and streamline processes, saving time and reducing errors. I am now
            looking to transition into a full-time software development role, where I can
            continue to learn and grow as a developer.
        </p>

        <p>
            I am currently completing a Software Engineering Bootcamp with HyperionDev and the University
            of Manchester. The course covers a wide range of topics, including Python, SQL, HTML, and CCS.
            I am also working on a number of personal projects, including a high-performance procedural
            terrain generation system for Unity, and a web-based project management tool.
        </p>
